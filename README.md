### ðŸ§© [Anomaly Detection on Human Activity Data âžœ](https://github.com/lexusimni/anomalytics-human-activity)

Detect anomalies in wearable sensor data using **Autoencoders, One-Class SVM, and Isolation Forests**. This project blends classical and deep anomaly detection approaches for **high-dimensional sequential data**.

---

### ðŸ¤– [LLM-Powered Smart Query Assistant for Tabular Data âžœ](https://github.com/lexusimni/LLM-Tabular-Assistant)

Simulate a smart assistant that responds to natural language queries on structured tabular data. This project integrates **LLM-style logic** with rule-based responses, mimicking GPT-like behavior without an actual model â€” ideal for tabular data exploration.
