# ðŸ§  Deep Learning Projects

Neural networks, but make it âœ¨usefulâœ¨. These projects go beyond textbook examples! Iâ€™m talking Transformers that classify, LSTMs that predict demand before it happens, Autoencoders catching weird behavior, and a smart assistant that answers spreadsheet questions like itâ€™s sentient.

### ðŸ”¤ [Transformer-Based Multi-Class Text Classification âžœ](https://github.com/lexusimni/Transformer-Text-Classification)

Fine-tuned **BERT and DistilBERT** models that handle multi-class text tasks like a pro. This oneâ€™s all about **transfer learning**, slick preprocessing, and performance that doesnâ€™t miss.

### ðŸ“ˆ [Multi-Product Demand Forecasting with LSTM âžœ](https://github.com/lexusimni/multi-product-demand-forecasting)

Built an **LSTM model** that knows what your storeâ€™s gonna run out of *before* you do. Think of it as a crystal ball for inventory; trained on multivariate time series data and sequence patterns.

### ðŸ§© [Anomaly Detection on Human Activity Data âžœ](https://github.com/lexusimni/anomalytics-human-activity)

Used **Autoencoders + One-Class SVMs** to catch weird motion patterns in wearable sensor data. Itâ€™s giving surveillance, but make it smart, high-dimensional, time-based, and no nonsense.

### ðŸ¤– [LLM-Powered Smart Query Assistant for Tabular Data âžœ](https://github.com/lexusimni/LLM-Tabular-Assistant)

Made a spreadsheet whisperer. Ask it a question about your data, and itâ€™ll clap back with answers like itâ€™s powered by GPT. All done with custom logic.. no actual LLMs required.
